# Twitapp

# Twitter App prototype &lt;UI Components only>
This is an implementation of a Prototype for Twitter App with only UI components. It includes only the 3 core screens of the Twitter - Profile page(as a Drawer), Timeline View and Search (Tab styled). Since this is UI only project, the Twitter feed has been embedded using a public Twitter feed. This has been implemented with atmost simplicity and still with the exact match to the Twitter App UI.
